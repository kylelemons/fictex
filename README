Formatting:

  *text*                Makes text bold
  /text/                Makes text oblique
  _text_                Makes text underlined
  [text] [text url]     Makes text into a link
  -- and ---            Makes n-dash (–) or m-dash (—)
  -----                 5 or more -s alone on a line makes a horizontal line
  <<text>>              Starts an lj-cut with text as the preview text
  >><<                  Ends an lj-cut
                        Empty lines separate paragraphs

Design:
- Each "fic" is a datastore entry with:
  - A ficid generated at random
  - Any number of "ficlets"
    - Each of these are actually a fic of themselves
  - Any number of "headers"
    - Standard headers are author, title, rating, fandom, warnings
    - Implemented as a []string of the keys and a map[string]string of values
  - Optional text
  - A boolean indicating if the fic is Complete (true) or WIP (false)
  - A boolean indicating if the fic is public (true) or private (false)

- The front page (/) will contain a description of fictex and a simple format textbox
- The read pages (/read/$ficid/$chapter) will render a fic
  - The bare read page (/read) can also render from POST
- The edit page (/edit/$ficid/$chapter) will handle creating or updating fics
- The publish page (/pub/$ficid/$chapter) will handle publishing the fiction to livejournal, fanfiction.net, etc
